        <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">
            <strong>Sany3y</strong> is a digital platform designed to connect skilled tradespeople and craftsmen
            (such as carpenters, plumbers, painters, electricians, and more) with people who need quick, reliable,
            and fairly priced services in their area. We make it easy for customers to find the right professional,
            view real reviews, compare price offers, and book a service in just a few minutes — all with a strong
            focus on quality and transparency.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-secondary">
            Each craftsman gets a simple profile page showcasing their work photos, specialties, service areas,
            starting prices, and customer ratings. The platform supports verified reviews to ensure users can always
            find trustworthy professionals.

            practical, and user-friendly community for everyone.
